# The Disaster_Response


Project Problem:

The data contained 30k real messages received during disasters. 
Each message is labeled with its category,Thereforeit's a multilabel classifier problem.

Project structure:

 1.Data Processing:  ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) pipeline that processes messages and category data from CSV file.
 
 2.Machine Learning Pipeline: Creating an ML pipeline that uses NLTK and GridSearchCV to output a final model that predicts message classifications 
 for the 36 categories.(Multi_Classification)
 
 3.Web development: The final results will be in a Flask web app that classifies messages in real time.
